        <h3>Event Producer</h3>

        <p>The event producer is responsible for logistics and ___ related to the event. They:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>make sure shifts are staffed ahead of setup.</li>
          <li>book any rental vehicles or heavy equipment needed.</li>
          <li>support setup lead during setup and teardown (not necessarily on site).</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Setup Lead</h3>

        <p>The setup lead is ultimately responsible for making setup happen. They:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>ensure that all necessary hardware, tools, parts, and equipment are obtained and on site.</li>
          <li>are on site during setup and teardown.</li>
          <li>make sure all crews are properly staffed.</li>
          <li>set up work area (crew tables, parts and panel staging areas, craft services, worklights, music).</li>
          <li>manage arrival, placement, and departure of vehicles.</li>
          <li>manage any outside parties (vendors, clients, cops, concerned busybodies, etc).</li>
          <li>mind schedule, re-balance teams, call in reinforcements, etc.</li>
          <li>frequently check in with crew leads.</li>
          <li>watch for potential problems, mistakes, safety issues, etc.</li>
          <li>help debug any problems that arise.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Crew Lead</h3>

        <p>There is a crew lead for each of the crews (Party, Business, Head & Hind, and Tech). Each crew lead is
          responsible for instructing (often inexperienced) crew members in safely assembling
          their part of the sheep. They should:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>read and understand the setup instructions ahead of time.</li>
          <li>be aware of the setup schedule.</li>
          <li>give crew members an overview of what they'll be working on, and communicate goals for the shift.</li>
          <li>demonstrate procedures (e.g. panel hanging).</li>
          <li>educate crew members on setup basics — sizes of hardware, names of tools, etc.</li>
          <li>if issues arise, help debug them and pull in the setup lead.</li>
          <li>watch for any safety issues.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Fluffer</h3>

        <p>Each crew should have a fluffer. The fluffer picks up stuff their crew drops, grabs stuff on request,
          makes sure they're hydrated and taking enough breaks, etc.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Noms</h3>

        <p>Noms manages the craft services table. Keep cold drinks (water, soft drinks) and light snacks available
          throughout setup. Coffee and pastries in the AM. For shifts that overlap normal meal times, and for shifts
          of four hours or more, provide something more substantial like pizza, a sandwich platter, or a traditional
          German stew made of marinated rabbit or hare with braised onions and a side of Spätzle and perhaps a nice
          seasonal vegetable. Why not?</p>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section class="crew-instructions all-crews" id="safety-section">
      <h2>Safety</h2>

      <p><b>Be careful.</b> Falling tools will hurt if they land on your head. Hardhats aren't a terrible idea. Try
        not to stand where something might land on you. Actively communicate what you're doing. Hold people's ladders
        steady. <b>Watch out for each other!</b></p>

      <p>Always test that the component you're about to balance against or stand on is actually secure. If you need to
        lean against or step on a strut for balance, place your weight only at the ends of the strut, never in the
        middle.
      </p>

      <p>When installing a component, <b>don't leave it partially secured and walk away</b>! Don't leave components or
        tools placed precariously.</p>

      <p>Wear boots or other footwear that protects your toes and has good grip. Wear gloves, especially when handling
        panels. Use sunblock. Hydrate.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="crew-instructions all-crews" id="setup-useful-info-section">
      <h2>Generally Useful Knowledge!</h2>

      <h3>Setup Crews</h3>

      <p>Setup is performed by four teams working simultaneously and (mostly) independently:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="crew-marker party-crew">The <b>Party Crew</b> puts up stuff on the party (driver/left/port) side of
          the bus. Their stuff is marked red.
        </li>
        <li class="crew-marker business-crew">The <b>Business Crew</b> puts up stuff on the business
          (passenger/right/starboard) side of the bus. Their stuff is marked green.
        </li>
        <li class="crew-marker head-and-hind-crew">The <b>Head & Hind Crew</b> puts up the face, head, neck, and rear.
          Their stuff is marked blue.
        </li>
        <li class="crew-marker tech-crew">The <b>Tech Crew</b> sets up sound and lights.
          Their stuff is marked orange.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Each crew has their own set of commonly-used tools marked with colored tape. Power tools are shared, and should
        be returned to the common table when not in use.
      </p>

      <h3>Identifying Panels</h3>

      <div class="sidebar">
        <img src="images/sample-label.png"/>
      </div>

      <p>
        Panels are (mostly) identified on each edge with a label. Party side panels have a 'D' in their name after the
        number, and a red dot. Business side panels have a 'P', and a green dot. Front panels' names start with an 'F',
        and rear panels start with an 'R'. Yes, this could have been thought out better. Sorry!
      </p>

      <p>
        Labels also indicate the neighboring panel for this edge, and which direction is up when mounted properly.
      </p>

      <p>
        One day, the labels will be printed and uniform. They'll show which section the panel belongs to. One hap-happy
        day. Not today.
      </p>

      <h3>Hanging Panels</h3>

      <div class="parts-needed">
        <h4>Requires:</h4>
        • Lots of heavy-duty zip ties.
        <br/>• Lots of <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub>&quot; bolts, various lengths, with wing nuts.
        <br/><b>Tools:</b> vice grips, aligner pins.
      </div>

      <p>For stationary setup, use heavy-duty zip ties wherever possible. In some cases, zip ties may not be strong
        enough and ¼&quot; hardware (bolt, two washers, and a wingnut) will be necessary. Use your judgement when
        hanging panels: if the connection is under a lot of tension or shearing force, use a bolt instead.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Pre-assemble sections of panels on the ground according to the panel map.</li>
        <li>Raise the panel or section of panels into place.</li>
        <li>Align edges of panel and use tapered steel aligner pin to line up holes. Pick a hole as near to the end of
          the edge as possible while still allowing zip tie or hardware to be inserted. Try to reuse holes from previous
          installations if possible.
        </li>
        <li>Use a vice grip to clamp the panel to its neighbor.</li>
        <li>Remove the steel pin and replace with a heavy-duty zip tie or ¼&quot; hardware.</li>
        <li>Tighten zip ties to medium tension. Tighten hardware finger-tight, but do not over-tighten.</li>
        <li>Remove vice grip.</li>
        <li>Repeat for the other end of the edge.</li>
        <li>Repeat for other edges on the panel or panel group.</li>
      </ol>

        </li>
        <li>Slide the punched angle iron protruding from the ear through the forward hole in the F16/F20/F17 panel
          assembly
          and bolt it to the stud.

          part
          of the column.
