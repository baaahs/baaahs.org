Our campouts are known for being whimsical, community driven, silly, and of course a whole lot of queer fun. We aim to create a safe space for self-expression, creativity and kindness. Live music, sparkle-tastic lights, dance parties, group events, art and other surprises included. Eccentric outfits, gifting and showing off the best of you is strongly encouraged. And much like Burning Man, it is a Leave No Trace event.',
