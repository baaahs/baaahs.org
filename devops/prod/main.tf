# The four backend buckets themselves, each of which needs to have public
# permissions set on it.
#
# Notice that while the static bucket is as you would expect - a default
# index.html and 404.html page, all of the other three buckets have the
# not_found_page set to be the index.html page. This is so that the client
# side React Router stuff will work. When it goes asking for crazy paths that
# the front-end folks just invented out of thin air, it will just shovel the
# same old SPA index.html page back. Now, it will send it with a 404 instead
# of a 200, but browsers don't seem to care. This is a much easier, albeit
# somewhat hacky and cache-busting, way to get the front-end routing working.
#
# Inspiration for this approach came from the github pages section of this
# documentation https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/
