      <p>About:</p>

      <p>BAAAHS is a BIG-ASS AMAZINGLY AWESOME HOMOSEXUAL SHEEP being built at<a href="http://www.nimbyspace.org/"> </a><a
          href="http://www.nimbyspace.org/">NIMBY</a> in West Oakland, birthplace of many art car legends.</p>

      <p>Debuting at <a href="http://www.burningman.com/">Burning Man</a> 2013,
        BAAAHS will be part mutant vehicle, part penetrable large-scale sculpture, and part gay disco.</p>

      <p>Flock Ewe is the theme camp where the BAAAHS project and crew will reside on the Playa.</p>

      <p>Some questions and answers from our flock, to ewe:</p>

      <p class="question">How does will this mutant vehicle benefit the GLTBQ community, overall?</p>

      <p class="answer">In the face of AIDS, survival was the first and only priority of the queer community for many years. While
        still a major threat the world over, we are able to once again regain our focus on the art and influence that was nearly
        wiped out in the 1980s. An entire artistic generation and their potential creative and vibrant contributions to
        the world, from<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Haring"> Keith Haring,</a>
        to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Mercury"> Freddy Mercury</a>
        to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvester_(singer)"> Sylvester</a>, were lost during the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reports_from_the_Holocaust:_The_Story_of_an_AIDS_Activist">AIDS Holocaust</a>.
        In 2013, we are the first generation of visible gays to reach middle age. And we want to
        celebrate in style. With a renewed faith, optimism, and polysexual vision, the next generation of queer
        counterculture is channeling the past while catapulting dance culture into the future. This art car will serve
        as our beacon of hope on and off the playa.</p>

      <p class="answer">Leveraging the booking talents of Honey Soundsystem co-founder Jacob Sperber, the queer talent being harnessed
        for our vehicle—to deliver our gay agenda through sound and interpretive dance—will be world-class DJ’s and
        performers who specialize in schooling the masses on finding their inner freak, trans/lez/homo studies, and inducing dance
        trances for finding your power tranimal. For each of the performers, collectives, DJs, and producers being asked
        to participate with BAAAHS project<a href="http://soundcloud.com/cocktail-damore/face-love-anew-original-mix">,</a>
        it’s not about being the biggest party, the most famous, or topping the charts. Their endeavors are next
        generation artistic projects with a focus on community, culture, activism, and queer history. While each are
        very successful in their own right, coming together in this way for Burning Man, it’s the first time this global gay
        underground music scene and community have been linked together with a single focus on the playa.</p>

      <p class="question">Is this sheep really the biggest gay socio-political mutant vehicle ever made?</p>

      <p class="answer">YES! We’re pretty sure it is. While queer and gay burners contribute to larger projects, we don’t know of
        another gay identified socio-political mutant vehicle project of this size and scale.</p>


      <p class="question">How will this bring the GLBTQ community closer to other camps, both gay and straight?</p>

      <p>In addition to providing sound for our talent, BAAAHS will be outfitted as an auxiliary sound system allowing
        us to literally plug-into and connect with camps all over Black Rock City, amping up their soundsystems as our gift to
        them and their party goers.</p>


      <p class="question">How will this art car directly impact GLBTQ burners on the Playa?</p>

      <p>As a catalyst for community intercourse our aim is twofold, to serve as a literal express service from the gay
        ghetto to the rest of Black Rock City and to provide a queer gift to burners at large from the gay community
        that
        will blow their minds (and not just their penises).
      </p>

      <p class="question">Why do this now?</p>

      <p>In recent years, LGBT burners have concentrated themselves in a single, and somewhat insular, gay neighborhood.
        Many of the offerings are of little interest to anyone outside the community. To be clear, we have absolutely no
        problem with the existence of the ‘gayborhood’, but we’d like to focus some energy toward disrupting the
        self–perpetuating isolation of gay burners by driving an art car right through the issue.
      </p>

      <p>As members of an increasingly inwardly focused minority community in BRC, we want to contribute to the larger
        community in a BIG way, and we’d like to offer our love back to the city in the form of an awesomely homesexual
        mutant vehicle that will get the gays out of the ghetto, bring gay burners to points of intercourse with the
        larger community, and also provide an entertainment platform of epic proportions for legendary gay DJ’s and queer
        performers to gaymaze anyone who crosses our path.
      </p>

      <p>We feel like too many gay burners’ entire experience of Burning Man is centered on 7:00 and D, and we think
        they would benefit from a reminder that there’s a big, awesome world of crazy fun waiting for them out on the playa.
        And now they’ve got a giant gay sheep-disco to take them there! For burners at large we want to provide an immersive
        queer experience that is also a beacon of HOMO, that may not read as such from their initial approach. It could
        be they find themselves dancing to some awesome music pumping out of a glowing sheep, then out of a poof of playa
        dust… a pack of psychedelic drag queens snatch them up into their disco embrace and provide an on the spot
        trans glamour makeover, sending them on their way—part male, part female, 100 percent touched by the queer culture of
        BRC. Regardless of the individual (gay, straight, bi) our goal is to share an undeniably unique queer gift that
        cannot be given anywhere else aside from gay discos, bathhouses or BRC.</p>


      <p class="question">Why a sheep &amp; what will he look like?</p>

      <p>As a medium for artistic expression, sheep are incredibly versatile (or in the case of our sheep,
        versatile-bottom:
        you enter through the rear). Sheep figure somewhere deep in the human experience as providers of food, clothing,
        something to count when you can’t sleep. Sheep are a metaphor for blindly following the mainstream (a complaint
        often lodged by deviant communities against the rest of humanity, but a fault that the LGBT community is guilty
        of all too often).</p>

      <p>Sheep can represent weakness and helplessness, and at the same time rams are symbolic of toughness and power.
        Dualities like this are common experiences in the gay and straight communities. And just by the fact we are
        burners, many of us can identify with the label of the “black sheep” from some point in our lives.</p>


      <p>And of course there is Philip K. Dick’s novel, the book Blade Runner was based on, “Do Androids Dream of
        Electric Sheep?”.</p>

      <p>Using all these elements for inspiration we will produce a socio-political statement, incorporating slightly
        futuristic dream-like imagery with fluffy (non-MOOPy) material, ethereal lighting effects and groovy soundscapes
        to help envelope, educate, and entertain.</p>


      <p>The sheep, while overtly homosexual, will not be sexually explicit. We intend for the piece to be humorous
        rather than lascivious, and we believe that it will work in different ways for different audiences, gay through
        straight and young through old. There’s certainly a suggestion of sexuality in the rear entry, but it’s more likely to be
        interpreted as silly playground humor by kids. For adult participants, the connotations conjured will be vast,
        as the symbology is very open to interpretation.</p>


      <p>His overall appearance will be cute and cuddly, innocent, euphoric and slightly mystified. This is juxtaposed
        with the unconventional method of ‘rear entry,’ providing participants and passengers a sense of mutual violation and
        pleasure as the sheep is repeatedly, consensually… errr… penetrated.</p>

      <p>Also, sheep are awfully adorable and approachable… Especially from the rear.</p>

      <p class="question">How does this fit into this year’s Burningman theme?</p>

      <p>The phrase “cargo cult” has come to be used as a verb in the software community: it describes the act of
        copy-and-pasting some code which you know works for some particular purpose, but you’re not really sure how or
        why; in other words, the superstitious repetition and perpetuation of other people’s patterns. This aligns pretty
        closely with some of the metaphorical senses of “sheep”: whether you’re blindly following the herd [e.g. others of your
        sexual orientation], or blindly following your personal messiah, you’re not thinking too hard about it, and
        you’re likely to follow along to some strange places before you realize what you’re doing. We intend to lead those who
        choose to follow us to the kind of adventures that only the open playa can provide, and we will convey them in
        comfort and style aboard our BIG-ASS AMAZINGLY AWESOME HOMESEXUAL SHEEP (BAAAHS)!</p>

      <p>The sheep says: BAAAHS.</p>
